How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It quickly isolated an obvious difference that would have been difficult
to fine otherwise.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It saves time and energy.
Rather than looking through the code line by line, specific areas to look
are isolated.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

The timing for an auto-saved commit may be inefficient. Manually saving
ensures that save points will occur at optimal times.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I would imagine this has something to do with autosaves vs manual saves. If multiple files were auto saved it might be hard to track your steps.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log will give an overview of all commits and description of changes. git diff will show itemized additions and subtractions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You will always be able to revert to a previous version if a bug appears

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I'd like to apply it to an actual project with my code
