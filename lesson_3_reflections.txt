When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When seeking contributions from other users. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git could pull changes prematurely. Manual pulls allow the remote to be updated with desired changed only.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of an entire repository including all commits along the way. A branch is one path comprised of commits in a repository. Forks are similar to clones but only occur on github. They cannot occur localy.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It helps ensure that you aren't creating potential conflicts with any changes you make.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Almost everything would be harder. Everything would have to be hand written or manually logged. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

It lets you experiment with changes without risking breaking the master branch. Too many branches could potentially get convoluted and create extra steps. It might be overkill for simple additions as you could always simply review previous commits.
