When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When seeking contributions from other users. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git could pull changes prematurely. Manual pulls allow the remote to be updated with desired changed only.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a copy of an entire repository including all commits along the way. A branch is one path comprised of commits in a repository. Forks are similar to clones but only occur on github. They cannot occur localy.
