When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When seeking contributions from other users. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git could pull changes prematurely. Manual pulls allow the remote to be updated with desired changed only.
